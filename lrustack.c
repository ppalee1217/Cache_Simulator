/**
 * This file contains some starter code to get you started on your LRU implementation. 
 * You are free to implement it however you see fit. You can design it to emulate how this
 * would be implemented in hardware, or design a purely software stack. 
 * 
 * We have broken down the LRU stack's
 * job/interface into two parts:
 *  - get LRU: gets the current index of the LRU block
 *  - set MRU: sets a certain block's index as the MRU. 
 * If you implement it using these suggestions, you will be able to test your LRU implementation
 * using lrustacktest.c
 * 
 * NOTES: 
 *      - You are not required to use this LRU interface. Feel free to design it from scratch if 
 *      that is better for you.
 *      - This will not behave like your traditional LIFO stack
